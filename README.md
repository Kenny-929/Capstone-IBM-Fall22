# Tree-Species-Detection-Capstone-Fall22
Data Science Capstone Project (ENGI E4800), Columbia University, Fall 2022

### Project Objective 
Use remote-sensing data (satellite image, tree canopy segments within imagery, and tree species labeled data) to understand characteristics of vegetation. It has several applications in tracking invasive species, understanding growth rate, above ground biomass and encroachment into utility power lines, railway lines, etc. Code multiple ML algorithms including deep learning pipelines to classify tree species.Build multiple tree species detection models.
